- Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.


```
Facades hide a complex or extensive API behind a small interface you can interact with without understanding all the details behind the scenes. Like we mentioned before, go-cloud is an excellent example of both adapter and facade, as it hides the complex details of talking to cloud providers behind a straightforward interface.
